# Codebasics Resume Project Challenge(#13)

## Overview
This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #13. The challenge involves analyzing the performance of GoodCabs, a cab service operating in Tier-2 cities, by addressing business questions raised by stakeholders. The project requires delivering insights through SQL and Power BI.

I have currently completed the ad-hoc requests section using SQL to provide quick insights for various stakeholder questions.

### Challenge Context
The challenge scenario involves a business review meeting between key stakeholders at GoodCabs:

- Bruce (Chief of Operations)
- Tony (Data Analytics Head)
- Peter (Data Analyst)

Peter is tasked with conducting a deep analysis on the company's performance over the last six months and responding to a series of questions, particularly those of an ad-hoc nature.

### Current Progress
**1. Ad-Hoc Requests**

The following ad-hoc requests were addressed using SQL:
- Quick insights on ride volumes, customer feedback, and operational efficiency.
- Identification of trends over the last six months.
- Focus on specific city-level performance to assist in decision-making.

**2. Primary and Secondary Questions (In Progress)**

The project also involves answering a set of primary and secondary business questions, with deeper analytical insights to guide GoodCabs strategy moving forward.

**3. Power BI Dashboards (Planned)**
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize key performance metrics.
- Build reports summarizing findings for stakeholders.

### Tools & Technologies
- **SQL:** Used for querying and ad-hoc data analysis.
- **Power BI:** To create interactive dashboards and visualize insights.

### Future Steps
- Finalize the analysis for primary and secondary questions.
- Develop Power BI dashboards for visual presentation.
- Prepare a comprehensive report for stakeholders.
